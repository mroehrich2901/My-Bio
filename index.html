        <h1>Michael</h1>
        <p><em>Computer Science Major</em></p>
        <p>My name is Michael, and I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science
            in order to become a Software Engineer. I am passionate about developing
            products and services through the use of programming technologies. I have experience 
            building applications in Java, particularly with the JavaFX library. I am also 
            skilled in web development using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love applying these skills to help individuals and companies perfect
            their software services.
